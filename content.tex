  % From 'How to construct a Nature summary paragraph'

  % A short abstract of fewer than 200 words is acceptable.

  % One or two sentences providing a basic
  % introduction to the field,
  % comprehensible to a scientist in any discipline.
  There exist millions of species on Earth,
  all originating from a common ancestor billions
  of years ago.
  The field of phylogenetics uses heritable material
  to determine which species are closest related and what are
  the mathematics that shape speciation.
  
  % Two to three sentences of
  % more detailed background, comprehensible to
  % scientists in related disciplines.
  In Bayesian phylogenetics, a DNA/RNA/protein alignment
  is used to infer a distribution of phylogenies and parameter estimates.
  To do so, we use assumptions that may be biologically unrealistic,
  but may give tolerable errors.
  
  % One sentence clearly stating the general
  % problem being addressed by this particular
  % study.
  Contemporary inference assumes that speciation
  never co-occurs.

  % One sentence summarising the main
  % result (with the words “here we show”
  % their equivalent).
  Here we show the error we make in our inference,
  when nature has varying degrees of co-occuring speciation.

  % Two or three sentences explaining what
  % the main result reveals in direct
  % comparison to what was thought to be the case
  % previously, or how the main result adds to
  % previous knowledge.

  % One or two sentences to put the results into a
  % more general context.


  % Two or three sentences to provide a
  % broader perspective, readily comprehensible
  % to a scientist in any discipline, may be included
  % in the first paragraph if the editor considers that the accessibility of the paper is significantly enhanced
  % by their inclusion. Under these circumstances, the length of the paragraph can be up to 300 words.
  % (The above example is 190 words without the final section, and 250 words with it).
