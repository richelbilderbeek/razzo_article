\section{Results}
\begin{itemize}

\item We expected the effect of $s$ on $e$ to be monotonously increasing
function (figure \ref{fig:h_1}). Figure \ref{fig:1} shows the effect 
measured in this experiment.

\item We expected the effect of the number of taxa on the relation
between $s$ and $e$ to be neutral (figure \ref{fig:h_5}). 
Figure \ref{fig:5} shows the effect 
measured in this experiment.

\item We expected the effect of the number of taxa on the variance
of $e$ for similar values of $s$ to decrease (figure \ref{fig:h_6}). 
Figure \ref{fig:6} shows the effect 
measured in this experiment.

\item We expected the effect of extinction on the relation
between $s$ and $e$ to be neutral (figure \ref{fig:h_2}). 
Figure \ref{fig:2} shows the effect 
measured in this experiment.
