\section{Results}

The inference error made for each of the parameter combinations
is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:results}. For both extinction rates,
we find, as expected, that the error increases for increased $\nu$
or $q$. Also in line with our predictions, we find no difference
between the two extinction rates.
